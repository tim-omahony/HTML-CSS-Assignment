            <p>Our homeless prevention and tenancy support team has one overarching goal: preventing people who have <br> experienced homelessness - and are now housed, from becoming homeless again. It means supporting people <br> to sustain their tenancies for as long as they need us.The shortage of affordable housing is one of the biggest <br> challenges people stuck in emergency accommodation face when trying to exit homelessness. <br> <br> Private rented accommodation is in short supply. Private rents far exceed rent supplement / housing <br> assistance payments. Competition to secure private rented housing is fierce. The public housing building <br> programme has a long way to go to meet current needs. When someone stuck in emergency accommodation <br> finds and secures housing they can afford, we aim to do everything possible to support them in sustaining <br> their tenancy and prevent them from returning to homelessness. <br><br>Our prevention and tenancy support team usually start working with people when they are stuck in <br> emergency accommodation. A comprehensive needs assessment is completed with each person - including <br> housing needs, and a care plan is agreed and implemented. Finding and securing housing that each person <br> can afford and is appropriate to their needs, can often be the most challenging.We have our own limited <br> stock of one and two-bedroom flats, but vacancies are rare. We work with other approved housing bodies in Cork with a view to securing appropriate housing for the people we support. We operate a Social Rentals programme where we lease properties directly from the private rental sector and sub-let them to people who are homeless at rates within the Rent Supplement / Housing Assistance Payment cap - and we commit to maintaining the property for the lifetime of the lease. We also support people in negotiating the assessment and application process for public housing. More often than not it takes time and patience, but the team is there for people every step of the way.</p><br>
